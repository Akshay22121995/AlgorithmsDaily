  #### What language should I use to code?
  All programming languages are more than just welcomed here.

  #### I have never used to Git or GitHub. What should I do?
  No worries! It's never too late to start learning. Check out this excellent [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) on Udacity to learn about Git and GitHub.

  #### How should I submit solutions?
  We have maintained a folder for each problem. Make sure your file format is as follows:-
 ```bash
 Name : <insert your name>
 Year/Department : <insert year/insert department>
 Email Id : <insert your E-mail Id>

 /*insert your code here*/

 ```

 Rename your file as `Language_Username` and place it in the appropriate folder.

 #### I forked the repository but some questions were added only after that. How do I access those?
  Open Git Bash or you Command Prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter the following commands:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/SVCE-HacktoberFest2019/AlgorithmsDaily.git
  git fetch origin
  git merge origin/master
  ```
  #### What do I do if I see a merge conflict?
This does not happen until you modify an existing file in the repository. The easiest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Merge it to the `master` branch, add your code and continue contributing :).

  #### I believe there is a mistake/error in one or more of the questions.
  Open an [issue](https://github.com/SVCE-HacktoberFest2019/AlgorithmsDaily/issues) on the bug tracker and we will get back to you.
